<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋</h1>

<p align="center">
  I'm a French student passionate about software development and open-source technologies.
</p>

<h2>👨‍🎓 About Me</h2>

<p>
  I'm currently in my third year of studies at the University of Marie and Louis Pasteur in Besançon, France (formerly known as Université de Franche-Comté).
  <br><br>
  I’m doing an internship at <strong><a href="https://github.com/infomaniak">@Infomaniak</a></strong> in Geneva, Switzerland. I’m part of the <strong><a href="https://github.com/Infomaniak/desktop-kDrive">kDrive Desktop</a></strong> team, where I help develop the desktop synchronization applications for <strong>kDrive</strong>, Infomaniak’s secure and privacy-focused collaborative cloud storage service.
  <br><br>
  I’m deeply interested in the open-source philosophy and self-hosted services. I enjoy building and using tools that promote transparency, privacy, and user control.
  <br><br>
  My main programming languages are <strong>C++</strong> and <strong>C</strong>, but I also have some experience with <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Bash scripting</strong>, and <strong>system administration</strong>.
